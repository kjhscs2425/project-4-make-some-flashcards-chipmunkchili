1. Write at least 3 questions and answers:

Q1: Finish the lyric:
    "The phone rings, in the middle of the night
    My father yells"
A1: "What you gonna do with your life?"

Q2: Finish the lyric:
    "Just a small town girl
    Livin' in a lonely world
    She took the midnight train goin' anywhere"
A2: "Just a city boy
    Born and raised in South Detroit"

Q3: Finish the lyric:
    "Never gonna give you up
    Never gonna let you down"

2. How many times will you show each flashcard the first time the user runs your flashcards program?
    Each card will show only once the first time the user runs the program.
    
3. How will the number of times you show each flashcard change the second time the user runs the program, based on their performance the previous time?
    If the user gets a problem wrong the first time, it will show twice the second time. If they get it right, it will show only once again. And if they keep getting the same question wrong, it will ask them again, the number of times they got it wrong (1st round wrong --> 2nd round twice, 3rd round three times, etc.)

4. What information will you need to store in a file in order to make the program change it's behavior each time the user runs the program?
    I will need to store which questions they got wrong and how many times they got it wrong.
